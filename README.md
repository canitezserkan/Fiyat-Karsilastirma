This program was developed for a MMORPG game called Knight Online as an useful tool 
in terms of showing to player whether the in-game items' selling prices are reasonable or not.
It was written with C#.

User can select any tradable item from the item list in program and after setting 
the other parameters about pricing, program displays the result instantly.
There is no database available for this program and no installation required.

Here is a youtube video link for demonstration about how the program works.
